# 🕔 Epoch Date Viewer
🧪 This is a very early prototype. <br><br>
🥱 Have you ever been tired of copying epoch timestamps and going to `https://www.epochconverter.com` to understand the timestamp better? <br>
e.g copying epoch timestamp from Postman / Snowflake / MySQL / etc <br><br>
😄 This custom application aims to help you stay focused without context switching over to the epoch converter web application. <br>

1. When an epoch timestamp is copied,
2. Human-readable date is displayed as mouse tooltips.
